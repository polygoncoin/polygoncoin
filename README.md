# About me

By education I am a Chemical Engineer (Last M-Tech from IIT-Kanpur).

My passion towards programming inclined me to opt for a programming based ChE job during 2001.

Later, I had to completely switch as a CSE professional.

As a CSE professional, I landed into web development with PHP (in 2007).

At present, (16+ years), I still love to work with PHP compared to other languages.

In 2023, I was also effected with other fellow mates because of AI boom.

So, I had ample of time to work on things, which I had at back of my mind to work on and share with the community. Thinking, they may help the nedy.

So, checkout the repositories, use them and ask for feature you feel is missing.
